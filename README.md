## 💡 Key Analytical Insights

### 1️⃣ Customer Retention by Segment
Certain customer segments demonstrate significantly higher retention, indicating strong loyalty and repeat engagement.

### 2️⃣ Churn Analysis
Churn is notably higher among low-frequency buyers, highlighting the need for targeted engagement and reactivation strategies rather than blanket promotions.

### 3️⃣ Repeat Purchase Trends
Customers enrolled in loyalty programs show higher repeat purchase frequency, reinforcing the importance of loyalty-driven retention.

### 4️⃣ Revenue Contribution by Customer Type
A relatively small group of loyal customers contributes a disproportionately large share of total revenue, emphasizing the value of retaining high-tier customers.

### 5️⃣ Store & Region Insights
Specific regions (notably Liverpool and Birmingham) exhibit higher churn rates, while store maturity and localized engagement play a key role in retention performance.
